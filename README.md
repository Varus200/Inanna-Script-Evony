NOTE: The accounts need to be fresh. You need to register the accounts first. Use this site: evony.com/index Use it in Chrome. If it doesn't send you to age 1, press back. With this link you can make long names with spaces.

First, go to cmdparams and enter the password for the alts. Next, look over the setting and make sure you have changed anything you need to change. Then, fire up the director, select the bot you will be using (its in the folder already), add your accounts to the director, and PRESTO!!!
